We needed at least 10 new statements not 10 references to code you wrote. Keep in mind quality over quantity.
Whilst I can see that you have made some improvements to the visuals of the viewer, I'm not sure why these
are necessary. The viewer has already been marked and thus your visuals would be better placed in your final GUI. 
However, I like your use of groups to organise the images added.

This is a good start to a GUI menu! Keep in mind that you need a way to move 'back' to the main menu. 
Each window is also a different size. Be careful to make sure that you don't make them larger than your main game window.
(Any larger and the user may not be able to view it on their laptop).
