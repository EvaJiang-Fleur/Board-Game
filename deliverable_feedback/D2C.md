## D2C Feedback

- Your viewer looks great! However you have a couple of small bugs:
    - You allow placements off the board (eg: dddd88). 
    - The stations on the left and right side of your board are displayed facing the wrong way. The black tracks
    should point inwards.
    
- I am disappointed to see that you have not utilised or implemented any of your skeleton. I am impressed that you have
completed so much of the assignment, but to do so you have hard-coded a lot of values. You should really consider 
refactoring your code to use Objects and Classes. You will lose marks for code quality if you do not make use of 
Object-Oriented programming concepts.

- I really like that you have defined your own helper methods, but these should be located within a relevant class (not 
Metro!) and should also be accompanied by a Java Doc. 

- I can see you have put a lot of work into what you have so far! If you can refactor your code to make use of Object-Oriented 
features, then I can see your group doing very well on this assignment! You still have just over 4 weeks before the final
deadline, which should be plenty of time to achieve this.
