#D2F Feedback

###General Review Feedback
- If you have found a case that produces an error, *why* do you think it produces that error? What is the error in the logic
behind the program? Your reviews mostly lacked discussion on *why* something in the program is 'good' or 'bad'. The more 
detailed you can be in critiquing each other's work, the more useful the critiques will be. There now aren't any more
deliverables before D2G, so it's up to you all as group members to critique each other's work to make improvements.
