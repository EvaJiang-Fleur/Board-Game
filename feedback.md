## Tutor Comment

- I would have liked to see better use of OO features. You have used strings as your primary representation instead of
creating objects and as a result your code is lacking modularity. Your Piece class was a good start, but you didn't actually
use this representation anywhere on your project.
- Your GUI is separated very well into each menu and functionality. This kind of separation is something that you should
aim to use in the rest of your program too. Helper methods should be split into different classes based on their functionality 
rather than being written in the Metro class.
- Overall your use of comments was ok, but each non-trivial helper method should have a detailed JavaDoc (like we supplied
for the Metro methods) accompanying it. 
- I would have liked to see greater use of JUnit tests. You should aim to test every method that you write so that you can 
be sure that it is working as intended.

Overall, you should be very proud of what you have achieved, your game looks great! You could have improved by making better
use of OO features, and JUnit tests and personalising your tutorial section of your game to explain to the user how to play 
your specific implementation.
