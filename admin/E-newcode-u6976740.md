# New Code for Deliverable D2E

## < u6976740 > < Yvonne Zhang >

For Deliverable D2E, I contributed the following new statements of original code:

- one new unit test on javafx(menu1test)
- create a new class(menu1) to make some improvement on out interface
- add background page in both menu1 and player
- add different categories in menu 1 and player
- exit the whole interface when you press the exit
- make the bottom better in the interface
- the bottom colour can change as you press the bottom
- use the contract color to emphasis the word
- try to link the page of menu and player page so they can switch(still in progress)
- create a new class(player) to make a interface for the player

(List at least 20, including at least one new unit test, and include line numbers.)
