comments:
  - it is good to make tile dragabble in the viewer class
  - it is good when the tile place in the wrong place, it can show the error message
  - it is good to use different classes to control the viewer page
  - the code is not quite well- documented, the code should be easier to read
  - it is better to create a new class for the main viewer
  - it is also better to reduce the redundant code for arrange the tile
  - the variable and the method can be read, but it can have easier way to simplify the code
  - the interface looks messy, it is better to arrange in a simple way
  - some function still cannot be achieved in the class(such as choose diffculty)
  - it is better to rearrange the code into different class, such as each class do the individual part of work, therefore, it can be easier to understand.
